DESCRIPTION OF YOUR CLASS DESIGN AND ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES USED:
Beginning with AnagramDictionary, if there are any exception cases such as invalid file
or duplicates, I will throw the esception and handle it inside of WordFinder.
For AnagramDictionary, Rack, and WordFinder I made use of the Hash/TreeMap package
to keep track of each dictionary input, rack list, and to handle the anagrams inside of word finder.
Knowing the fact that maps are sorted by default by keys, I used a comparator in order
to sort by value (score) and be able to print out results from user input in decreasing order
and also alphabetical order.

----------------------------------------------
ANY OTHER NOTES FOR THE GRADER:
Exceptions are handled in main (WordFinder.java)
